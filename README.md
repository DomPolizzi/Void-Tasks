# Void Tasks

An app designed for Task Management for those who welcome a little chaos while still having some guiding light.

## Specs:
- Flutter App

## Later CSS:

    Background Color:
        Use a dark background color as the foundation for your theme. Common choices include deep blacks (#000000), dark grays (#333333), or dark navy blues (#121212).

    Text Color:
        Ensure text is highly readable by using contrasting text colors. For dark themes, light gray (#CCCCCC) or white (#FFFFFF) are often good choices for text color.

    Accent Colors:
        Choose accent colors that stand out against the dark background. Popular accent colors for dark themes include shades of blue (#007ACC), green (#00A372), or orange (#FFA500).

    Link Colors:
        Use distinctive colors for hyperlinks to make them easily identifiable. Colors like bright blue (#007ACC) or neon green (#39FF14) can work well.

    Button Colors:
        Buttons should be visually distinct. Consider using a slightly lighter or contrasting color for buttons to make them stand out. For example, light gray buttons on a dark gray background.

    Borders and Dividers:
        Consider using subtle borders or dividers with shades of gray or slightly darker versions of your background color to create visual separation between elements.

    Hover and Active States:
        Define hover and active states for interactive elements like buttons and links. You can use color changes, shadows, or animations to indicate interactivity.

    Background Patterns or Textures:
        Consider adding subtle background patterns or textures to break up large expanses of solid color and add visual interest.

    Focus States:
        Make sure that focus states for input fields and interactive elements are clearly visible. Using a bright border or glow effect can help users navigate through the interface.

    Dark Mode Toggle:
        If your app allows users to switch between dark and light themes, include a toggle button that is easily accessible. Make sure the toggle's appearance clearly indicates the active theme.
